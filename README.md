A project of repeat photography of historical images taken along the Big Creek drainage, located in Idaho's Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. The comparison of historical and contemporary photographs, in conjunction with stakeholder interviews, gives insight into the human and environmental changes that have occurred in the past century, and the values of those changes.
