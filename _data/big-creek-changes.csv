Human and Environmental Changes,Aviation,4% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,4%,"Changes in aviation included observations on airstrip ownership changing from private to public, and changes in backcountry aviation use (though the direction of change varies among stakeholder observations).",
Human and Environmental Changes,Climate,2% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,2%,"Changes to the climate were observed in drought conditions and impacts (e.g. coniferous species showing signs of beetle kill), and the presence of snow; seeing snow in photographs elicited questions of snowpack variability over time.",
Human and Environmental Changes,Development,26% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,26%,"Photographs show effects of development in the past, including grazing, ranching, building, vegetation control, manipulation of the landscape. Structures, cabins, hangars, machinery, and other signs of human inhabitation have disappeared or lessened. The photos show changes to how the drainage was used, and the activities that took place there. Stakeholders observe that the culture and community of Big Creek has changed since wildermess designation.","“Well, changes on Big Creek would be-- I mean, obviously, when you lose and you keep taking away all the amenities in there, that's big change. But that changes, in a nutshell, the people and their [identity]. They close that road, people couldn't access their mining claims and different things... But there [were] people living there in the summers... I mean, that's all changed. There's no one, obviously-- now, there's no cabins, even, left.” Participant 1, Inholding Resident"
Human and Environmental Changes,Fire,13% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,13%,"Changes in policy have impacted fire management and frequency. The great fire in 2000 left scars and mosiacs, seen by snags and burned coniferous vegetation on the landscape. Apart from wildfire, fire played a key role in the reclamation of the landscape during wilderness designation: many of the structures on Big Creek were burned during the late 1970s, as the US Forest Service reclaimed the area and turned it back to ""wilderness"".","“And so it's just all when that particular ecosystem becomes right for fire it's probably going to burn in the temperate zone. That's all part of the deal. And so those are the changes that we've seen. It's gone from that mature stand typically all over the district to restart.” Participant 2, Fire Management"
Human and Environmental Changes,Hunting,2% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,2%,"Big Creek is well known by hunters as the place to go for elk hunting, and used to be heavily trafficked. Stakeholders commented that the trailhead at Smith Creek is significantly less busy now than it used to be at the beginning of hunting season, and there are fewer outfitters and hunters in Big Creek now, due to changes in the elk population and the out-of-state tag system. Additionally, hunting boundaries have changed, as observed in the repeat photographs by looking at areas that have burned, or where elk populations have been impacted by wolves.",
Human and Environmental Changes,Trails,2% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,2%,"When looking at the photographs of Big Creek, stakeholders remark on the amount of wood in the river, and on the burned hillsides. These signs remind stakeholders that the fire left a lot of dead wood, which has diminished access on Big Creek itself, and has choked trails that used to lead up and out of the river drainage. The trails not heavily trafficked by recreationists and packers, but used by outfitters in the spring and fall, are becoming less accessible and less trafficked.",
Human and Environmental Changes,The Tukudeka,2% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,2%,"The photographs show and speak to some of the cultural and archaeological sites that now mark the presence of the Tukudeka (Sheepeater Indians), who lived in the greater area for millennia. The Tukudeka, a nomadic band of Shoshone people, were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and relocated to Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho during the Sheepeater Campaign of 1879.","“And as I said earlier too, that's an archeological site. There's many places in there where there's markings on the rocks. And there's a cave. And there's living areas and dwelling areas. But all of that was used for living and people moving through that area. And so, a lot of our ancestors probably used that area for hunting, and fishing and gathering plants.” Participant 15, Shoshone-Bannock Tribe"
Human and Environmental Changes,Vegetation,20% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,20%,"As vegetation is one of the most visible components of the repeat photographs, there are many observable changes in vegetation. These changes include: response of riparian areas after the fire in 2000; the effect on vegetation from the lack of grazing livestock; invasive species and noxious weeds; heritage and cultural plants as reminders of Tukudeka and homesteader presence; changes to the type and density of vegetation (coniferous, deciduous, woody, shrubs, riparian); observable impacts on vegetation from drought conditions.","“...go down Big Creek and a good share of that drainage was burned. Now you're looking at one of the snazziest riparian zones around. Nothing's grazing it. The moose are gone. The elk will come in a little bit in the winter but that's about it... It's about as nice of one as you'll ever see for that part of the country.” Participant 8, Wildlife Resources"
Human and Environmental Changes,Water,2% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,2%,"Observed changes of water in the repeat photographs show that managed and natural changes have impacted water quality, and water's position on the landscape: Big Creek was pushed back at Cabin Creek; Acorn Creek was diverted at the old Dewey Moore homestead; bank stabilization of Big Creek occurred at Taylor Wilderness Research Station; silt deposition in the creek has changed since the wildfire.",
Human and Environmental Changes,Wilderness Management,11% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,11%,"Wilderness management practices seek to maintain the wilderness character of the landscape. In the late-1970s, before wilderness designation, the US Forest Service reclaimed the wild landscape by burning, burying, and/or removing most signs of human inhabitation and influence along the Big Creek drainage. Changes in how wildfires are managed in wilderness areas, moving towards ""let it burn"" instead of the ""10AM Rule"", has significantly altered the landscape, as burned areas are seen in the photographs from the large fire in 2000. Additionally, the reintroduction of wolves as part of wildlife management in the wilderness area has observable changes from stakeholder perspectives and observations.","“But one of the things that I think that we also saw is an effort to erase the human impact from the landscape and to return it to what some people saw as pristine, untrammeled environment. So as time went on, those cabin sites began to disappear.” Participant 19, Stream Ecology | “Huge one is fire management, and how the Wilderness Act met with management, how fire ecology has been interpreted and just letting fires burn, and trying to get [that] back to that natural fire regime that used to be out there. But prior to that, to our existing management style, where we just let fires burn, there was the 10 AM rule where every fire had to be out by 10 AM.” Participant 11, Wilderness Management"
Human and Environmental Changes,Wildlife,16% of coded references to human-environmental changes in interviews,16%,"Stakeholders observe many changes in wildlife, including seeing signs of beaver activity in riparian areas; the reduction in anadromous fish in Big Creek; and the reduction in charismatic megafauna in the drainage, such as elk, bighorn sheep, and moose.",

So when you talk about sense of place, I mean, you can see how much it was deforested and if I'd have let it, that would've destroyed my sense of place. So what I had to do is look down. I couldn't look and mourn that. I just had to look for regrowth and I'd see signs of seedlings and we'd see more bugs in the water and stuff like that. And just by starting to look down close at the land, you didn't get as overwhelmed with the change and the loss of forest."""
Values of Human and Environmental Changes,Backcountry Community,5% of coded references to values of human-environmental change,5%,,"“And see, when your [Forest Service] went in there, they were really helpful, good people, and they had their own stock… They didn't have government stock. And so, they were just like the rest of us. But then, as it kind of progressed and of course, all of that changed along with everything else, why then, all of a sudden it was their forest and we were whatever, squatters. And so, then stuff really changed. But before, they would do anything for Forest Service people.” | ""They close that road, people couldn't access their mining claims and different things, and whether they could have actually mined them or not, I don't know. But there are people living there in the summers, definitely, all up and down from there all the way down to the mouth of Crooked Creek, even going up Crooked Creek. I mean, that's all changed. There's no one, obviously-- now, there's no cabins, even, left."""
Values of Human and Environmental Changes,Cultural History,7% of coded references to values of human-environmental change,7%,,"""It is interesting because I think a lot of people have this notion of wilderness and this is a common thing you read about in essays. That humans are removed from the landscape and wilderness and it's a place where we shall not remain, untrammeled land. But in fact, they've always been a part of the landscape.

Values of Human and Environmental Changes,Historical Preservation,4% of coded references to values of human-environmental change,4%,,"“…a lot of times the historic preservation really depends on who you have working at the Forest Service... a lot of the historic structures on Big Creek have disappeared. And that's because people that have been managing it don't believe that they are a part of the wilderness. And I come from more of the perspective of you can't just erase all history. We as humans are as important to the landscape as anything else. And so you should at least… have made more of an effort to save examples.” | ""And so there were a lot of historic structures and non-historic structures - modern trucks, all kinds of things - along that whole corridor. And once the wilderness was designated, all of those things had to be evaluated one-by-one and assessed whether or not they should be kept. And the decisions that were made over time about what's valuable and what should be kept and what shouldn't be kept changes with new people in management - not necessarily because of personality changes, but also the time. It's hard for people -- there was a lot of removal just across the forest of historic structures in the '50s that were built turn of the century that today would just be phenomenal craftsmanship. We would never dream of removing those things. But in the '50s, they were a dime a dozen. And so you can't necessarily judge the acts when to them, they might have only been 50 years old, those structures. And they just didn't recognize what the value would be for people today."""
