Following Cabin Creek upstream leads to open, livable space. After the Homestead Act of 1862, white settlers began to move into the Big Creek area. Cabin Creek was of particular interest due to the presence of the open meadows in an otherwise steep and rocky drainage. From that point onward, Cabin Creek was home to squatters, settlers, homesteaders, farmers and ranchers during the pre- and post- WWII era, dude ranchers, and outfitters.",,,"Cabin Creek; Big Creek; Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, ID",45.1294,-114.9347,DSC_0558.JPG,2019-07-08,09.jpg,Date Unknown,image/jpeg,repeat_photograph,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/fcrnrw_024a.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/small/fcrnrw_024a_sm.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_024a_th.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_024b_th.jpg
fcrnrw_025,Looking east at Big Creek and the Cabin Creek meadows,1955 and 2019,"The large meadow in these photographs was hayed during much of the time Cabin Creek was occupied by year-round and part-time residents, up until this land was designated wilderness in 1980. Of note is a particular change to the riparian vegetation. In 1955, there were more willow stands in the meadow and the cottonwood grove seen in the contemporary photograph was not present. 

Big Creek has braided and re-channelized, shifting position with the assistance of human and natural forces in the past 60 years. Some differences are due to channelization with the intent of creating more hay pasture; the fire in 2000 also played a role, moving more sediment into the riverbed and along the banks. 

Some changes cannot be captured in a repeat photograph, such as what the rest of Big Creek looks like in this meadow area, or what wildlife are or are not present. Moose were frequently seen in Cabin Creek meadows but their population declined after the big fire of 2000. The fire should have stimulated food for the moose, as it did in Crescent Meadows where the willows exploded in numbers. Initially, however, the moose were at a disadvantage with little food and little cover after the fires, and so were vulnerable to starvation, and to predation by wolves and mountain lions.",,,"Cabin Creek; Big Creek; Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, ID",45.132,-114.945,DSC_0024.JPG,2019-06-12,2300.0150_Hay Meadows at Cabin Creek_Ervin Bobo_ 1955.jpg,1955,image/jpeg,repeat_photograph,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/fcrnrw_025a.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/small/fcrnrw_025a_sm.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_025a_th.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_025b_th.jpg
fcrnrw_026,Cabin Creek looking north,1954 and 2019,"The ungulate populations along the Big Creek drainage and Cabin Creek have changed over time, such as with moose, elk, and mule deer. Cabin Creek was once a place to spot large herds of elk, but numbers have dwindled significantly in the past 20 years. Some folks will attribute this population decline to the introduction of wolves, while others will argue elk weren’t historically a part of that landscape. Others might see the wildfire of 2000 to blame for pushing elk out of the area.

Cabin Creek is a popular location for outfitting. This change to elk populations has not only impacted success during hunting trips but has also altered the amount of traffic Cabin Creek sees during the late summer and fall. It is hard to make a living taking customers on a elk hunting trip when it is hard to find elk, and the terrain is difficult to traverse due to the steep slopes and downed, blackened snags. Many outfitters couldn’t do it anymore, but there are still some who tough it out and make it work, because elk or no elk, Big Creek, Cabin Creek… this area is home to them.",,,"Cabin Creek; Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, ID",45.1348,-114.9235,DSC_0407.JPG,2019-06-24,1680.0236_Winter Range on Cabin Creek D-8_1954 (2 of 3).jpg,1954,image/jpeg,repeat_photograph,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/fcrnrw_026a.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/small/fcrnrw_026a_sm.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_026a_th.jpg,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/objects/big-creek-rephotography/thumbs/fcrnrw_026b_th.jpg
fcrnrw_027,"Small cabin built by Bill Wallace at Cabin Creek, restored",1993 and 2019,"Most of the structures built at Cabin Creek no longer exist. In the mid- to late-1970s, the US Forest Service went through the Big Creek drainage and reclaimed much of the land. During the process of reclamation, the US Forest Service purchased most of the private holdings in the drainage and burned, buried, and/or removed most of the structures and equipment. 

The process of wilderness reclamation along Big Creek, and especially at Cabin Creek, finds multiple perspectives and parties at a crossroad of opinions and values. At the time of reclamation in 1975, most of the structures at Cabin Creek were only around 30 years old, and weren’t old enough to be categorized as historically significant. To burn and remove these structures was consistent with Wilderness Act regulations and intents, and purist wilderness philosophy.

Others think of the historical and cultural significance these original cabins could have had, had they been kept in the area. Only two buildings from the original Wallace homestead on Cabin Creek were kept and restored: one was dismantled and transferred to University of Idaho's Taylor Wilderness Research Station, and the other is seen in this photograph here.

Rex Lanham moved in after purchasing the Wallace ranch, and the cabin stayed on their homestead until the US Forest Service purchased the Lanham ranch during wilderness reclamation in the mid-1970s. Over 100 years later, the cabin is now used during the field season to house the US Forest Service trail crew. All else from this original site, however, no longer exists.
